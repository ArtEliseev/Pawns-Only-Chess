# Pawns-Only-Chess
My seventh project in JetBrains Academy

Description
Our game is almost complete. One more thing remains — we need to establish the win/draw conditions.

The game is over when either player succeeds in moving their pawn to the last opposite rank — rank 8 for White, rank 1 for Black. The game is also over when all opposite pawns are captured.

Stalemate (draw) occurs when a player can't make any valid move on their turn.

Objectives
The program should check whether the winning or stalemate conditions are met after each turn.

If the winning conditions are fulfilled, print White Wins! or Black Wins!, depending on the situation. Then, print Bye! and exit the program.

If it's a stalemate, print Stalemate!, Bye! and exit the program.
